#### What is Synco?
[Synco](https://synco.tk) is a website for writers to publish work online. We are currently in Alpha prerelease, but are soon to be in    Beta stages. We take pride in having original code, but we are equally proud of using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), owned by [Google](https://google.com), and [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io), which is a fantastic fuzzy search library. We also use smaller external libraries created by admins.
#### How Do I Start?
Just go onto [https://synco.tk](https://synco.tk) and sign up. It is free and easy to create stories, and just as easy to edit.
#### Upcoming and Beta Features:
- [ ] Pro Accounts
- [x] Ability to Create and Star Stories Freely
- [x] Accounts
- [x] Admin Accounts
- [ ] Story Rating
- [ ] Age Appropriate Reccomendations
- [x] Searching
- [ ] Advanced Profiles
- [ ] Private Story Drafts

#### Almost at Beta!
We've worked for a while now on a project called Synco, and it has flourished beyond are hopes and dreams. While we've closed the Dev Program, we are still hiring programmers and designers to help us make Synco even better.
